Finest Html5 Canvas and WebGL Workshops.

DevState is a collaboration by Frank Reitberger http://www.dasprinzip.com/ and Sakri Rosenstrom http://www.sakri.net 

With a combined 30 years of programming under our belts, we have cherry picked a number of key programming techniques which we have applied to html5 canvas and webGL  This repo is the source code of http://www.devstate.net , which is a collection of demos which we intend to use in workshops which we will be giving to agencies, companies with inhouse dev teams, schools, intersted groups etc. 
The purpose of posting this repo in Github is to provide the source code of all our website demos to our current and potential customers.
