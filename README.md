Finest Html5 Canvas and WebGL Workshops.

DevState is a collaboration by Frank Reitberger http://www.dasprinzip.com/ and Sakri Rosenstrom http://www.sakri.net 

DevState creates workshops which we would personally have wanted to attend.  We have cherry picked a number of key programming techniques which have been essential to us during our combined 30 years of programming. We have applied these concepts in a curated set of html5 Canvas and WebGL demos which can be found on our website http://www.devstate.net

Prior to a workshop, attendees are asked to select a number of demos which they would like to master.  We will in turn create a custom workshop based on these selections. 

The purpose this repository is to provide the source code of all our website demos to our current and potential customers, as our website will contain minified code.
