DevState is a collaboration by Frank Reitberger http://www.dasprinzip.com/ and Sakri Rosenstrom http://www.sakri.net

With nearly 30 years of Flash experience under our belts, we have selected a number of key techniques which we have
honed and used in the trenches of working for agencies.  We have translated these techniques into the world of HTML5 Canvas
and WebGL.  This repo is the source code of http://www.devstate.com , which is a collection of demos which we intend to
use in workshops which we will be giving to agencies, companies with inhouse dev teams, schools, intersted groups etc.
The purpose of posting this repo in Github is to provide a single location for our customers to review ideas which we
have included in workshops.
